# General Purpose Python
There are lots of free resources for learning about the basic syntax of python. I won't repeat them by building another into to python tutorial here, please spend some time familiarising yourself with the basic syntax.

## Resources
For a complete beginner, I really rate JVDP's [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf) to get you started. It's thorough but succinct and, although it can get a bit deep for the beginner in places, I think it's one of the best intro's to python from a data analysis perspective.  

Working through pages 1 - 61 and 66 - 76 will cover the basics and then there's a really quick overview of other packages we'll cover in pages 84 - 90 and recommendations for further learning resources on pages 90 - 91.  

### Other useful intro/overview/quickstart resources
1. [DataCamp: Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
1. [Coursera: Python for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis)
1. [Coursera: Plotting in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting)
1. Chapters 1 - 9 for the [Code Academy Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course.

### Deeper resources I'd recommend:
1. JVDP's [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) 
1. Katy Huff and Anthony Scopatz's [Effective Computation in Physics](http://physics.codes/). 
1. Wes McKinney's [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) (specific to the Pandas library, but has good intro material to general python and the Numpy library).
