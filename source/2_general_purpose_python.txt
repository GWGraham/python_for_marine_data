# General Purpose Python
There are lots of free resources for learning about the basic syntax of python. Not going to repeat these here, please spend some time familirising yourself.

## Resources
I really rate JVDP's [www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf](A Whirlwind Tour of Python) to get you started. It's thorough but succinct and, although it can get a bit deep for the beginner in places, I think it's one of the best intro's to python from a data analysis perspective.  

Working through pages 1 - 61 and 66 - 76 will cover the basics and then there's a really quick overview of other packages we'll cover in pages 84 - 90 and recommendations for further resources on pages 90 - 91.
