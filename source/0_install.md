# Install and Setup

## Installing Python and Jupyter using a pre-packaged Distribution
I strongly recommend installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which includes all of the common packages for scientific computing and data science that we'll be covering here.

First, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). Opt for the latest Python version (3.6 or higher).

Second, launch the installer that you've just down loaded and follow instructions

Congrats! You've just installed Conda (the Anaconda package manager), Python (the programming language), Juypter (an application for creating and sharing code) and a whole host of other packages for scientific computing. You'll see various shortcuts automatically added to your system startbar by the installer. We'll explore some of these here on in. Feel free to have a poke about and explore!

## Extras
If you're using a Windows machine, it would also be worth installing the source control software [Git for Windows](http://gitforwindows.org/).

Download the self extracting installer (There's a 'Dowload' button on the Git for Windows landing page)and follow the instructions.

The install contains a whole lot of useful stuff, including git BASH which is a kind of linux terminal emulator for Windows. We won't use this immediately, but it'll be super useful later on.
