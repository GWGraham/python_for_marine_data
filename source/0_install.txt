# Install and Setup

## Installing Python and Jupyter using a pre-packaged Distribution
I strongly recommend installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which includes all of the common packages for scientific computing and data science that we'll be covering here.

First, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). Opt for the latest Python version (3.6 or higher).

Second, launch the installer that you've just down loaded and follow instructions

Congrats! You've just installed Conda (the Anaconda package manager), Python (the programming language), Juypter (an application for creating and sharing code) and a whole host of other packages for scientific computing. You'll see various shortcuts automatically added to your system startbar by the installer. We'll explore some of these here on in. Feel free to have a poke about and explore!
